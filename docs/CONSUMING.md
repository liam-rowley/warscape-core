# Consuming the core from a game repo

How a game repo (napoleon-remastered first) uses warscape-core at a pinned version. **Proposal, 2026-10-28: nothing is wired into
a game repo until Liam approves.**

## Recommendation: a git submodule at `core/`, pinned to a release tag

The game repo carries the core as a submodule at `core/`, checked out at a tag (`v0.1.0`), and repeats the tag in its `wsc.toml`
(`[core] version = "v0.1.0"`). Commands run from the game repo root as `python3 core/wsc.py <verb>`.

Why this one: it is the only option where "a game repo never patches the core in place" (napoleon `PLAN.md` section 4) holds by
construction. An edit inside `core/` cannot be committed to the game repo; it can only be pushed to warscape-core, through a PR.
The `core_pin` gate adds the rest: it fails when the checkout is not the pinned version or has local changes.

## The options compared

| | Submodule at `core/`, tag-pinned (recommended) | Subtree (`git subtree add --squash`) | Vendored copy + `VERSION` | `pip install` from a git tag |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| The pin | the gitlink sha in the diff, plus `[core] version` | a squash commit message | the `VERSION` file | a requirements line |
| In-place patching | impossible to commit; `core_pin` fails on a dirty checkout | easy and silent; would need a tree-hash gate against the tag (network) | same as subtree | not possible, but edits in site-packages are invisible |
| CI on a private core | needs a read token secret (below; not while the core is public) | no auth | no auth | a token **and** an install step (breaks "no installs") |
| Fresh clone | `git clone --recurse-submodules`; forgetting it fails loudly (hook and CI say "core missing") | plain clone | plain clone | plain clone + pip |
| Agent sessions | attach both repos; `git submodule update --init` | nothing extra | nothing extra | pip through the proxy |
| Upgrade | three commands (below), one reviewable diff | `git subtree pull --squash` (merge noise) | copy and commit (large diff) | bump one line |
| History cost | none | the core duplicated in game history | same | none |

Costs of the recommendation, and what covers them:
- **CI token.** Only while the core is private (it is public since at least 2026-10-29, so checkout needs no token): the default
  `GITHUB_TOKEN` of a game repo cannot read another private repo. Liam creates a fine-grained personal
  access token with **Contents: read** on `warscape-core` (and the game repo), stored as the secret `WARSCAPE_CORE_TOKEN` in each game
  repo. A deploy key on warscape-core is the alternative (read-only, one per game repo).
- **Clone discipline.** The submodule URL is relative (`../warscape-core.git`), so it follows whatever remote the game repo was cloned
  from: HTTPS through the agent proxy, HTTPS or SSH on Liam's PC. The pre-push hook refuses with "git submodule update --init" when
  `core/` is empty.
- **Agent sessions** attach `liam-rowley/warscape-core` (read) next to the game repo; one extra `add_repo`.

## Wiring a game repo (the steps, once approved)

```sh
git submodule add ../warscape-core.git core
git -C core checkout v0.1.0
git config core.hooksPath core/.githooks          # per clone, also on Liam's PC
# write wsc.toml (below), then:
python3 core/wsc.py reg render                    # creates the empty registries and their views
python3 core/wsc.py reg add tools --missing       # rows for every tool that has a header
python3 core/wsc.py gates
```

Minimal `wsc.toml` for a game repo:

```toml
registries_dir = "registries"

[registries]
tools = "core:tools"
scenarios = "core:scenarios"
assets = "core:assets"
ui_elements = "core:ui_elements"
engine_sites = "core:engine_sites"
config_keys = "core:config_keys"
hotkeys = "core:hotkeys"
engine_facts = "core:engine_facts"

[core]
version = "v0.1.0"

[tools]
exempt = ["tests/**", "**/runs/**"]

[docs]
max_kb = 30

[cli]
verb_dirs = []        # e.g. ["adapter/verbs"] for game-specific verbs (same contract as warscape/verbs/)
```

CI in the game repo (`.github/workflows/gates.yml`):

```yaml
name: gates
on: [push, pull_request]
permissions:
  contents: read
jobs:
  gates:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 10
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5
        with:
          submodules: true
          token: ${{ secrets.WARSCAPE_CORE_TOKEN }}
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v6
        with:
          python-version: '3.12'
      - run: python core/wsc.py gates
```

## Upgrading and releasing

- **Core release:** a PR bumps `VERSION`; after Liam merges it, the tag `vX.Y.Z` is cut on that merge commit. Tags are never moved.
- **Game upgrade:** `git -C core fetch --tags && git -C core checkout vX.Y.Z`, set `[core] version` to the same tag, run
  `python3 core/wsc.py gates`, commit `core` and `wsc.toml` together on a branch.
- **A change a game needs** is a PR here with host tests, then a release, then the upgrade above. Never a commit inside `core/`.

## Registry storage and views (0.6.0, opt-in)
Two `wsc.toml` tables, both off by default (a repo that sets neither keeps one JSONL per registry and committed views):
```toml
[storage]
dir = ["jobs", "tools"]     # these keep one file per row: registries/<name>/<id_to_file(id)>.json
[views]
commit = false              # views go to the git-ignored dir (default "_scratch/registries"); a committed registries/<name>.md fails
```
- **Why:** two branches in flight that each add a row to one JSONL, or re-render one committed view, conflict on GitHub (it ignores
  `merge=union` on pull-request merges), so auto-merge stalls until someone merges `main` by hand. One file per row and uncommitted
  views remove both causes (napoleon J55).
- **Switching:** `python3 core/wsc.py reg migrate <name> --to dir` moves the rows and rewrites `[storage] dir`; `--to jsonl` goes back.
  With `commit = false`, `git rm` the committed `registries/*.md`, git-ignore the views dir, and drop `merge=union` for the moved
  registries. Read rows through `warscape.registry` (`load_all`, `Registry.rows`), never by opening the file, so a reader follows
  either storage. The file-name rule is `id_to_file` (percent-encoding; docstring in `warscape/registry.py`).

## The proxy, the harness and the save tools (0.4.0)
From 0.4.0 the core carries the proxy DLL's core (`proxy/src`), its host tests and tools (`proxy/tests`, `proxy/tools`), the PC
watcher kit (`harness/`) and the ESF save tools (`saves/`). A game keeps its adapters: `proxy/<game>/` (adapter.cpp, identity.json,
the generated tables and config file, lua/) and `harness/<game>/` (adapter.json, profiles/), plus its registries. The tools find
them through `proxy/tools/layout.py`: the game root is the superproject that pins the core (or `$WSP_GAME_ROOT`), and the adapters
are `wsc.toml` `[proxy] adapter` / `[harness] adapter` when set, else the one `proxy/*/adapter.cpp` / `harness/*/adapter.json`.
Run them from the game repo as `core/proxy/tools/build.sh`, `core/harness/job.sh` and so on; `python3 core/proxy/tools/layout.py`
prints what they will use. The DLL build id hashes the inputs' content under role names, read through the gitlink for files in
the core, so moving them here kept every game build id (napoleon J12). The core's CI builds and tests them against the null game
(`proxy/tests/null_game/README.md`).
